<p> We seek to buy and consign authentic pre-owned luxury goods that fit our niche at a fair market value. We focus on items in gently used, like new, or new condition, with no significant defects. If an item has been repaired, it must have been done so at a factory authorized repair center. We are selective in the designers we buy and sell and generally do not focus on designers that have a presence in outlet stores or discount retailers.</p>
